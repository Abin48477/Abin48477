# 💫 About Me:
🌟 Hi, I’m Abin — a student with a love for technology and creativity.  
I don't just code. I create with logic, design with purpose, and learn with discipline.

🧠 Always exploring:  
• Full-stack web development  
• Clean code and good design principles  
• The balance of tech and philosophy  

💡 Got a vision? I’ve got the curiosity and skill to build it with you.  
Let’s turn thoughts into tools and code into value.

🎙 Fun Facts:  
📖 I enjoy reading the **Bhagavad Gita** — it keeps me grounded and inspired.  
✍️ I write code like a poet – rhythm in logic, patience in chaos.
